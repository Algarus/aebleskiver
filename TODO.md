# Todo:
    * Add personal messaging between users
    
    * Move the pub/sub channel and client containers to Redis for persistance (instead of memory) 
      so that multiple node instances can access the same data

    * Add loading notices for everything
    
    * Change title tag on new messages (Omegle)
      or allow user to play a sound (Convore)
      
    * Make all links open in a new tab / window
    
    * Don't scroll the message window if a user isn't already
      at the bottom of it, to allow reading previous
