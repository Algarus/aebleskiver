# Todo:

* Add loading notices for everything

* Change title tag on new messages (Omegle)
  or allow user to play a sound (Convore)
  
* Make all links open in a new tab / window

* Don't scroll the message window if a user isn't already
  at the bottom of it, to allow reading previous
  
* Alert the user when they are disconnected or when the 
  server is about to restart
  
* Firefox CSS outline bug on 'rooms / users'

* Add flood control to rooms, allow users to create a room without 
  flood control on, but have it set by default.  Either 10 messages
  per minute, or a 1000 char limit per minute
  
* Replace default icon with a Guy Fawkes mask
      
# Ideas:

* Create 'music' channels, in which an admin of the channel can start up a 
  https://github.com/Marak/JSONloops program, and then each client can listen
  and change the music.
  
* Integrate the program with Google / Yahoo! mail, replacing a room view 
  with an inbox
