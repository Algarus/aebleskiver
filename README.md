This project is currently under development, it may undergo radical changes in the near future.

This project is a node.js chat application, serving as a testing grounds for Backbone and DNode
pub/sub mechanics.  Hopefully this can help others learn how to use the technologies involved in 
this project, as it has for me.  This project is only for fun, so enjoy!
